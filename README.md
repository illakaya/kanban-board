# Kanban Board

## Description
 
This project was completed from starter code to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Completing this kanban board allowed me to understand Third-Party APIs like Bootstrap, jQuery and jQuery UI and the power of search engines when using the correct key terms. Through thsi project, I learnt to:

- Use jQuery to traverse the DOM
- Use event delegation by using `.on` instead of using `addEventListener`
- Add Bootstrap class to format html elements
- Utilise jQuery widgets and interactions
- Work with `Day.js`

## Credits

Thank you to:

- The Coding Bootcamp at the University of Sydney for providing a project for students to develop their understanding of Third-Party APIs where I made massive references to Week 5 Lesson 28 Student mini project for majority of the project
- Instructor Frank Fu and teacher assistant Sean Butcher for providing the foundational knowledge required to attempt the project
- Initially used code suggested by Fabio Montefuscolo on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3231459/how-can-i-create-unique-ids-with-javascript) on line 22 of script.js but ultimately it was removed
