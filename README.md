# Kanban Board

## Description
 
This project was completed from starter code to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Completing this kanban board allowed me to understand Third-Party APIs like Bootstrap, jQuery and jQuery UI and the power of search engines when using the correct key terms. Through thsi project, I learnt to:

- Use jQuery to traverse the DOM
- Use event delegation by using `.on` instead of using `addEventListener`
- Add Bootstrap class to format html elements
- Utilise jQuery widgets and interactions
- Work with `Day.js`
